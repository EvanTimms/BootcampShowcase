# YelpCamp

The final project in the course, this website is designed for a fictional startup company that brings together all of 
the topics and material covered in this course. Built using the Express framework and Bootstrap for fast HTML and CSS development. Users on the site can view campgrounds stored using MongoDB. Routing is done via the REST architecture. When fully finished, the site will support proper authentication and will be deployed using Heroku. Each campground has a name and image associated with it, and later versions will have a price.
